[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:10 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findgz_gui_vendor.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "gz_gui_vendor", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "gz_gui_vendor"
  with any of the following names:

    gz_gui_vendorConfig.cmake
    gz_gui_vendor-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "gz_gui_vendor" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "gz_gui_vendor_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "gz_gui_vendor" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
